    "\n",
    "### Cancer Hallmark Focus: **Evading Immune Destruction**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of hallmark:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cancer cells hijack the body's immune checkpoint systems (the \"off switches\" that prevent the immune system from attacking our own cells). This allows tumors to escape detection and destruction through three strategies: camouflage (hiding from detection), coercion (suppressing immune responses), or cytoprotection (protecting against immune attack).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key mechanisms: activating checkpoint molecules (PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4) that shut down T cells, hiding tumor markers, releasing immunosuppressive signals (TGF-β, IL-10), and recruiting cells that help the tumor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genes associated with hallmark to be studied:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. CD274 (PD-L1 gene)**\n",
    "* **Role:** Makes PD-L1 protein that acts like a \"don't attack me\" signal on tumor cells, shutting off immune responses when it connects with PD-1 on T cells\n",
    "* **Pathway:** Activated by inflammatory signals and cancer-promoting pathways (PI3K/AKT, JAK-STAT)\n",
    "* **Significance:** Most commonly exploited immune escape mechanism; target of many FDA-approved immunotherapies\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. PDCD1 (PD-1 gene)**\n",
    "* **Role:** Makes PD-1, a brake pedal for T cells. High levels indicate \"exhausted\" T cells that can no longer fight effectively\n",
    "* **Pathway:** High PD-1 levels are a sign of exhausted T cells that have been overstimulated\n",
    "* **Significance:** Blocking PD-1 can reactivate exhausted T cells and restore their cancer-fighting ability\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. CTLA4 gene**\n",
    "* **Role:** Makes CTLA-4 protein that shuts down T cells during early immune response in lymph nodes\n",
    "* **Pathway:** Blocks CD80/CD86 molecules that would normally activate T cells, preventing them from multiplying and attacking\n",
    "* **Significance:** First immune checkpoint successfully targeted in cancer therapy (drug: ipilimumab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. HLA genes (MHC Class I: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and B2M**\n",
    "* **Role:** Create molecules that display cancer markers on cell surfaces (like ID badges for immune cells). When tumors lose these, they become invisible to T cells\n",
    "* **Mechanisms of downregulation:** Loss of transporter proteins (TAP1/TAP2), B2M mutations, reduced transcription factors, or DNA methylation\n",
    "* **Significance:** Very common in cancers; helps tumors resist immunotherapy\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. TGFB1 (TGF-β gene)**\n",
    "* **Role:** Produces powerful immunosuppressive signal that disables killer T cells and NK cells\n",
    "* **Effects:** Creates immunologically inactive tumor environments where immune cells are absent or unable to function\n",
    "* **Significance:** Major contributor to immunotherapy resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. IDO1 (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 gene)**\n",
    "* **Role:** Makes enzyme that starves T cells by depleting tryptophan and creating toxic metabolites\n",
    "* **Pathway:** Tryptophan breakdown pathway\n",
    "* **Significance:** Being tested as drug target in combination immunotherapies\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. IL10 gene**\n",
    "* **Role:** Creates IL-10, an anti-inflammatory signal that prevents dendritic cells from activating T cells\n",
    "* **Significance:** Helps create an immunosuppressive tumor environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3)**\n",
    "* **Role:** Another immune checkpoint that shuts down T cell function by interfering with how they recognize targets\n",
    "* **Significance:** Early marker of T cell exhaustion; FDA-approved drugs target this (2022)\n",

    "### Biological Mechanisms (Anatomy, Organ Physiology, Cell & Molecular Physiology)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:**\n",
    "* Cancer is damaged DNA that changes how cells grow\n",
    "* Starts with a single cell acquiring multiple mutations over time, transforming into a cancer cell capable of unlimited growth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Main Gene Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Oncogenes (accelerators):*\n",
    "* Normally help cells grow; when mutated get stuck \"on\"\n",
    "* One mutated copy can cause problems (dominant effect)\n",
    "* Examples: RAS, MYC, EGFR, HER2\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tumor Suppressors (brakes):*\n",
    "* Normally stop damaged cells from dividing; when lost, cells grow unchecked\n",
    "* Both copies usually need inactivation (recessive effect)\n",
    "* TP53 is the \"guardian of the genome\"\n",
    "* Examples: TP53, Rb, BRCA1/BRCA2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular Mechanisms:**\n",
    "* **DNA mutations:** Single nucleotide substitutions (KRAS mutations in 5% of cancers), chromosomal rearrangements (BCR-ABL fusion in leukemia)\n",
    "* **Epigenetic changes:** Activate/deactivate genes without changing DNA sequence\n",
    "* **Gene expression alterations:** Genes acting differently without DNA damage (more common than mutations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Step Process:**\n",
    "* Cancer requires multiple mutations accumulated over time\n",
    "* Explains age-related cancer risk (more time = more mutations)\n",
    "* Cancer cells compete; those with survival advantages take over\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Cancer Hallmarks (Shared Across Types):**\n",
    "* Sustained proliferation, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death\n",
    "* Enabling immortality, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion/metastasis\n",
    "* Immune evasion, reprogramming metabolism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cancer Type Differences:**\n",
    "* Same mutations cause different cancers depending on: cell type, tissue context, timing, microenvironment, cooperating mutations\n",
    "* Some tumors have <5% of cancer genes mutated, suggesting alternative paths\n",
